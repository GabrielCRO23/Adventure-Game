## Currently only the Papyrus character gets past the character selection screen. Game stops shortly after Sans appears.

Undertale-themed text-based adventure game. 

This project was my first larger vanilla JS project I tried creating, but it quickly became very difficult to manage. It was a great learning experience and a good way to learn why code should be component-based & organized. I initially intended to add localization to this project.. also I mistakenly uploaded the node_modules folder. Also the files are a mess. I'll keep it that way - everyone learned someway! I spent a long time on this as shitty as it is, even manually wrote the keyframes for the effects
