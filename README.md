Undertale-themed text-based adventure game. Currently only the Papyrus character gets past the character selection screen.

This project was my first larger vanilla JS project I tried creating, but it quickly became very difficult to manage considering the method I used. It was a great learning experience and a good way to learn why code should be component-based & organized. I initially intended to add localization to this project.. also I mistakenly uploaded the node_modules file.
